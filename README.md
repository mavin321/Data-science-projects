# Data Science Projects  

Welcome to my collection of data science projects! This repository showcases various projects where I apply data analysis, machine learning, and statistical techniques to solve real-world problems. Each project demonstrates my expertise in data preprocessing, model building, and visualization using Python and its powerful libraries.  

## üîç About  

This repository is a compilation of my work in data science, featuring projects that involve:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Cleaning, visualizing, and understanding data trends.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Training and evaluating models for predictive analysis.  
- **Data Processing**: Handling missing data, feature engineering, and optimization.  
- **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other tools to present insights.  

  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools  

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost  
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, OpenCV, NLTK  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
